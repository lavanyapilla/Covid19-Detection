## Overview
This project demonstrates about detecting a person is infected with covid or not from chest X-ray Scans using Convolutional Neural Networks. My model achieved nearly 93% testing accuracy. This application can be 
widely used in Medical Secotrs.

## Motivation
What to do when you are at home due to this pandemic situation?.Doing some important things will lead you better in future,so Finally i worked on a application (real world application) to actually make a difference. I created this application with an intention to help people who are willing to test their health conditon.
